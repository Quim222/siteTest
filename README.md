# PetAlert

Welcome to my project! This is a comprehensive application and website designed to help you find your lost pet or assist other users in locating theirs. Whether youâ€™re searching for a missing pet or want to contribute by helping others, this platform aims to create a supportive community for pet owners.

This repository is dedicated to the website, which I developed using React and Vite to ensure a fast and responsive user experience. For backend services like the database and user authentication, I integrated Firebase, leveraging its robust and scalable infrastructure.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or report any issues. Together, we can make a difference in reuniting pets with their families!
